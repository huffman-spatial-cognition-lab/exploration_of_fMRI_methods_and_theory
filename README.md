# Explorations_of_fMRI_methods_and_theory
This repository contains Python notebooks and instructions for running explorations of activation analysis and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to demonstrate the interplay between fMRI methods and theory. I use these explorations in my teaching of an undergraduate cognitive neuroscience course at Colby College. I developed the code for these notebooks using the Nilearn tutorials as a starting point (hence, I am using their BSD license here), but I heavily modified the code to showcase the importance of fMRI methods on shaping our theories of how the brain produces cognition.

## There are three basic methods for running the notebooks
* Method 1: JupyterHub (via your institution)
* Method 2: Jupyter Notebooks (via a local installation)
* Method 3: Google Colaboratory (no installation required)

For Method 1 and 2, please see the folders jupyter_notebooks. For Method 3, please see the folders colab_notebooks.

## I also include both the student notebooks and completed notebooks (for instructors)
The student notebooks are within the notebooks_for_students folder and the completed notebooks (for instructors) are in the completed_notebooks folder.

## Where can I find more information?
Please see the Wiki for more information about how to download the code, prepare your machine, and run the notebooks:

## Citation and attribution for these notebooks
These exercises were written by Derek J. Huffman with the base Nilearn tutorials as a starting point.

If you find these notebooks to be helpful in your teaching, research, etc., then please cite the following sources:
