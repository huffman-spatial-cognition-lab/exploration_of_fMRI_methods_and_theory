# Explorations_of_fMRI_methods_and_theory
This repository contains Python notebooks and instructions for running explorations of activation analysis and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to demonstrate the interplay between fMRI methods and theory. I use these explorations in my teaching of an undergraduate cognitive neuroscience course at Colby College. I developed the code for these notebooks using the Nilearn tutorials as a starting point (hence, I am using their BSD license here), but I heavily modified the code to showcase the importance of fMRI methods on shaping our theories of how the brain produces cognition.

Please see the Wiki for more information about how to download the code, prepare your machine, and run the notebooks:

If you find these notebooks to be helpful in your teaching, research, etc., then please cite the following paper:

These exercises were written by Derek J. Huffman with the base Nilearn tutorials as a starting point.
